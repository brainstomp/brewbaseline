On any new mac this is what I install to get my basic needs going.

   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
2nd Accept the xCode command line tools license:
   xcodebuild -license
   
3rd run the installmytools.sh file
   bash ./installmytools.sh
